# Day 4

Combine your answers from Day 2 and Day 3 to get the address of an important Knoxville building. Using this one-word name as a key, apply a Vigenere-like cipher to the text contained in the file `secretCode.txt` that can be found in this repo.

Your cipher should include both letters and numbers, with A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25, 0 = 26, 1 = 27, ..., 9 = 35. The resulting message will be used on the final day.
