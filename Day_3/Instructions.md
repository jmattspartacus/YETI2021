# Day 3

What is the fifth smallest number that can be written as both the sum of three sequential primes and the sum of nine sequential primes? (You may want to start by generating a list of prime numbers, then use this list to answer the question.)

An example: 187 is the sum of [59, 61, 67] and [7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
